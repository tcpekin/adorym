# TODO

1. Change cm -> nm
2. Support complex number operations
3. Compare initial probe function from ROP to what Adorym gets from ifft
4. Add initial probe generation from parameters.
5. Is the normalization in `propagate.py:285` the source of the differences in magnitude? 

# Notes

* `this_pred_batch` is raw data magnitudes (sqrt)
* Fresnel propagator is the same.
* `repeating_slice` is similar to equal slices?
